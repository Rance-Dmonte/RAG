FAQ-BOT 

This project demonstrates a simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline built in Python. It uses sentence-transformers to generate embeddings for FAQ text chunks and cosine similarity to retrieve the most relevant answer to a user query. 

This bot can only be used for retrieval only since the model used for generation is not yet used.
